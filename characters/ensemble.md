A basic overview of the characters:

- Elizabeth: early career creative that has fallen into direction from a mix of strong headed nice and a need for someone in a failing company to stop the bleeding.

- Scott: lead developer who works at a place that sucks

- CJ: Elizabeth's gay jimminey cricket

- Kris: limp wrist, capricious CEO of a company that is really an ego project.
