<!-- Running late -->
"DON'T WALK", this phrase was making Elizabeth more and more late.
Of course, had she been a bit earlier this torturous wait would have been passed on to the next pedestrian.
What's more, had she been a bit later she could have caught the green and _have a coffee in her hand_.
All the same, she's here, on this crosswalk, waiting, becoming more late, and more late.

<!-- Thoughts on the stupid meeting -->
Why was this meeting called anyway?
Kris probably wants to hear himself talk about a plan.
He will ask for feedback.
And once the giver of feedback is done--not a moment before--he will reject it.
Why we are trading hot air instead of doing necessary work for this start-up is something that vexes Liz every day of her life.
And at 9:30 a.m. no less!

<!-- TODO(ajone239): do we need space about what liz does here? -->

<!-- Walk  -->
"WALK".
With the routine of a flowing river, she fobs in, navigates to her desk, drops her bag while getting her laptop out, and glides to the meeting room.
She opens a frosted glass door to be met with, "...", silence.

"Oh. Hii, gurl!", CJ was the first to look up from his phone.
The rest of the team was still in their trance, and of course Kris was no where to be seen.

<!-- The meeting -->
"Sorry, sorry, sorry, jet-lagged as I am, it can be very hard to make all the meetings this business takes.", explained away Kris as he walks in with a coffee and sunglasses coming off.
Kris is, of course, short for Kristov.
Kristov, of course, meaning Christopher in the land of _wherever he was from_.
This means that, despite the humble brag, he probably was jet-lagged.
Bringing the humble brag back in as evidence, he undoubtedly doesn't now what this business takes.
But he had money, and just as importantly a lack of competence that gave Liz the latitude to explore her craft.

"Okay, okay, okay, so I called this meeting to talk about some new features for our product that I think are really going to make our product great.
I and the in-house team have been talking at length about how we can better hook the frontend to the backend and add some new features to the catalogue.

Liz had to interject, "These features sound well and good, but will there be space in this meeting to talk about our client out reach campaign?"

"Of course, of course, of course, that campaign is important.
But in all my business experience, a product that is great reaches out to all its clients on its own.Frankly, that's why I'm in this business.
We here at Company Inc. are in this industry to push the envelope.
We're here to do the undone.
We're here drive innovation.
We will be great!"

"I understand that you want to make a 'Great Product', but I can't understand why you want to keep iterating on a usable application that has yet to get any users.
We need to firstly make ourselves and our function known.
Then when we have people looking for us we give them a place to look."

"The users will come.
Excellence shows itself off.
People need us even if they don't know it.", assured Kris in a way that required a high delivered from ones own supply.

"Well," started Liz, "I think you are right."

"But, of course."

"With that, shouldn't it have a place to show itself?"

"Oh, but certainly," said Kriz.

"Man, I wish we had somewhere to strut our stuff.", said Liz all but wry.

"We have our website!"

"That stuffy old thing. I guess you want users coming to us from dial-up."

"We'll have it remade--and greatly at that!", declared someone who was certain they were having their own idea.

Elizabeth, with a saccharine smile, said, "What a great idea!."

...

In what must have been a conspiracy to break his focus, an email from his boss came into his inbox with a notification akin only to clickbait.
"NEW CLIENT WORK RESPONSE NEEDED".
Clicking into the email revealed:

```
Hey Scott,

We just got a request to redo the website for this small company in town.
The client wants their website redone.
The client seems to not really know what "redone" means to them...
And they want you onsite...

Nevertheless, they have deep pockets, so when can you and the team go help them?
As per the subject, don't put this your planner to respond to tomorrow.

Best,
Mr. Boss
```

Sweet, nothing makes a project run more smooth than poor definition coupled with someone old enough to need a web team onsite.
All the same, we'll do the choppy once so it can be "wrong", then do it _slightly_ different and we can all feel big and get paid.

```
Mr. Boss,

Sounds fun as ever.

Send me their pitch, contact info, and a link to the site.

The onsite thing is rough, but wifi is wifi.
We can start next week, but be aware that it will slow the other project.

-- Scott
